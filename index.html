    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Investors have become more conservative. There is a palpable resistance to sponsor the unvalidated ideas. 
      There is a fear of messing up! None disputes the value that AI can bring upon. It is a <b>GOLD RUSH</b>. <br>
      AI is no more hype and Gen AI is no more a shiny object in the hand. It's real and happening. Organizations have started thinking beyond <b>"THE ART OF POSSIBLE"</b> <br> 
      The focus is more on <b>"THE ART OF MAKING AI OPERATIONS FEASIBLE"</b> <br>
      The question is - How do You incorporate AI into your Go-To-Market strategy, encourage innovation, and drive repeatable business.
      You need a sure shot mechanism for creating the Centers of Excellence that deliver results. <br>
      
      Good intentions won't work, Good mechanisms do!   <br>
      You need a LEAN MECHANISM that can SCALE. <br><br>
